# Insights

**Notes / Initial Observations:**  
- Hypothesis: Catch probability varies by time-of-day; morning may have higher catch rates.  
- Question: Does hourly granularity provide significantly more predictive power than coarse buckets?  
- Placeholder: No data analyzed yet.  

**Insights Added:**  
*TODO*  

1. Hour-of-day seems predictive even without environment data.
2. Data sparsity will be an issue → smoothing + aggregation needed.
3. Privacy matters more than accuracy at first → better to underfit than leak data.
