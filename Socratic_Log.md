### 1. Seed Idea

**Motive:** Capture design intent and see how to expand the seed idea.  

**Context:** Exploring initial design space for a prediction service.  

**Prompt A (design alternative):**  
> “I want to create a Prediction API for prediction target being how likely you are to catch a fish on different hours of the days (morning, afternoon, evening, etc).”  
→ Option considered: start with a coarse, time-of-day target (4 buckets).  

**Prompt B (red-team):**  
> “Isn’t this too simplistic — shouldn’t you include weather, location, or season instead of just time-of-day?”  
→ Risk checked: over-simplification may limit predictive power.  

**Inflection point:**  
- Realized starting too complex could stall progress, but starting too simplistic might undercut project value.  
- Decided to frame time-of-day as the *minimum viable baseline target* and note weather/location as stretch goals for later iterations.  

**Evidence:** No code yet; just project sketch notes.  

**Outcome:** Defined project identity as **CatchChance**, with prediction target = probability of catching at least one fish by coarse time-of-day.  

**Attribution:** Seed phrasing and example prompts came from me; AI helped structure the decision into baseline vs stretch-goal framing.
