### 1. Seed Idea

**Motive:** Capture design intent and see how to expand the seed idea.  

**Context:** Exploring initial design space for a prediction service.  

**Prompt A (design alternative):**  
> “I want to create a Prediction API for prediction target being how likely you are to catch a fish on different hours of the days (morning, afternoon, evening, etc).”  
→ Option considered: start with a coarse, time-of-day target (4 buckets).  

**Prompt B (red-team):**  
> “Isn’t this too simplistic — shouldn’t you include weather, location, or season instead of just time-of-day?”  
→ Risk checked: over-simplification may limit predictive power.  

**Inflection point:**  
- Realized starting too complex could stall progress, but starting too simplistic might undercut project value.  
- Decided to frame time-of-day as the *minimum viable baseline target* and note weather/location as stretch goals for later iterations.  

**Evidence:** No code yet; just project sketch notes.  

**Outcome:** Defined project identity as **CatchChance**, with prediction target = probability of catching at least one fish by coarse time-of-day.  

**Attribution:** Seed phrasing and example prompts came from me; AI helped structure the decision into baseline vs stretch-goal framing.  

### 2. Brainstorm Kickoff
**Context:** Initial brainstorming on predicting fish-catching probabilities.  

**Prompt A (Design Alternatives):**  
> “List 2–3 ways to model short-horizon catch probability using coarse time-of-day and optional hourly breakdown.”  
**Option Tested:** Baseline probability per hour bucket (majority-class + Laplace smoothing).  

**Prompt B (Red-Team):**  
> “What are the limitations or risks of relying on time-of-day alone?”  
**Risk Checked:** Ignores weather, location variability, and individual angler skill.  

**Inflection Point:**  
Decided baseline is viable for early testing but must later incorporate weather and location features.  

**Evidence:**  
Offline baseline check on synthetic CSV (100 rows, 30% positive).  

**Outcome:**  
Kept hour-bucket baseline; planned feature expansion for weather/location.  

**Attributions:**  
- AI: Suggested alternative baselines and red-team critique  
- You: Selected baseline approach and designed test
