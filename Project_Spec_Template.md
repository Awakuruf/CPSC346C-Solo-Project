# CatchChance — very rough idea

- Goal: show anglers a chance of catching a fish soon (next hour).
- Output: probability 0–1, maybe just “35% chance this evening.”
- Why: helps decide when to go fishing.
- Inputs: hour, day, maybe location, maybe weather.
- First model: just use past catch rate by hour.
- Concerns:
  - Data privacy (GPS sensitive)
  - Needs to be cheap/free-tier
- Next: define more formally.
